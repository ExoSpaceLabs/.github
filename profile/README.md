**Expanding with Space**

## About Us

ExoSpaceLabs is an open-source organization dedicated to developing cutting-edge software for space exploration, research, and real-time systems. Our goal is to provide high-performance, reliable, and scalable solutions that drive innovation in the aerospace industry.

### What We Offer
- **[CCSDSPack](https://github.com/ExoSpaceLabs/CCSDSPack)** – A powerful C++ library for handling CCSDS packet-based communication (current release v1.1.0).
- **[HardRT](https://github.com/ExoSpaceLabs/hardrt)** – HardRT is a minimal Real Time Operating System designed to be the core of more complex systems (current release v0.3.1).

### Projects
- **[EXN](https://github.com/ExoSpaceLabs/exn)** – open-source demonstration payload that combines a Raspberry Pi, STM32 (RTOS), and FPGA into an integrated Earth Observation system.
  - **[EXN-GS](https://github.com/ExoSpaceLabs/exn-gs)** –  Linux GS system communicating with exn-mcu node. Providing TUI, daemon and HardRT simulation.
  - **EXN-MCU-RTOS** - The MCU Control Node is the supervisory brain of EXN. It runs on an STM32 with HardRT (WIP).
  - **EXN-Pi-Camera** - The Pi Camera Node is responsible fo Captures images, pre-packets or streams raw data (WIP).
  - **EXN-FPGA-AI** - FPGA (Processing Node) performs preprocessing, AI inference, and postprocessing of image on Fabric (WIP).

### Future Projects May include ###
- **Space Data Processing** – Libraries and tools for handling space mission data efficiently.
- **Exploration & Simulation** – Software for simulating space environments and mission scenarios.
- **Acceletation Designs** – VHDL / Verilog designs to accelerate space related processing.

- **Modular payload systems** - Multi-device in coordination performing dedicated tasks.
